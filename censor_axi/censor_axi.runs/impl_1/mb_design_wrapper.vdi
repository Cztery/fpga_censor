Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net mb_design_i/censor_ip_0/inst/censor_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/censor_main_inst/hashing/hash_rotating/is_bad_word is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mb_design_i/censor_ip_0/inst/censor_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/censor_main_inst/hashing/hash_rotating/flag_set_i_2/O, cell mb_design_i/censor_ip_0/inst/censor_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/censor_main_inst/hashing/hash_rotating/flag_set_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT mb_design_i/censor_ip_0/inst/censor_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/censor_main_inst/hashing/hash_rotating/flag_set_i_2 is driving clock pin of 15 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
